# 🤖 AI Systems Engineering Overview

This document presents a structured overview of AI systems engineering based on the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBoK). It covers the anatomy of AI platforms, tools, methods, architectural patterns, integration strategies, and operational practices for building scalable, secure, and intelligent systems.

System integration is the process of assembling software and hardware components into a unified system that meets functional, performance, and interoperability requirements. It ensures that independently developed modules, services, and platforms work cohesively across organizational boundaries, enabling end-to-end workflows, data consistency, and operational efficiency.

## 🧰 Methods Used in System Integration

- **Interface Definition & Specification**  
  Define APIs, data contracts, and communication protocols using OpenAPI, GraphQL, or WSDL.

- **Middleware & Message Brokering**  
  Use tools like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Azure Service Bus for asynchronous communication.

- **ETL/ELT Pipelines**  
  Extract, transform, and load data using Airbyte, Fivetran, or custom Python/SQL pipelines.

- **Service Orchestration & Choreography**  
  Coordinate microservices using BPMN engines (e.g., Camunda) or event-driven choreography.

- **Data Mapping & Transformation**  
  Normalize and translate data formats using Talend, Informatica, or custom transformation layers.

- **Testing & Validation**  
  Apply integration testing, contract testing (e.g., Pact), and system-level validation.

## 🧱 Common Architectures

| **Architecture Style**     | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) | Modular services with well-defined interfaces, often using SOAP or REST. |
| Microservices Architecture         | Independently deployable services communicating via APIs or event streams. |
| Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)    | Systems react to events using pub/sub models for loose coupling.          |
| Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)       | Centralized integration backbone for routing, transformation, and mediation. |
| API Gateway Architecture           | Unified entry point for APIs with routing, authentication, and caching.   |

## 📋 Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Data privacy and user consent
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure access to integrated systems
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
