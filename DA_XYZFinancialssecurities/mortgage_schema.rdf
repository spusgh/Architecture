<!-- This RDF schema defines a simple model for mortgage loans and customers.
     It includes classes for Loan and Customer, and a property to link them. -->
     <!-- The schema can be extended with additional properties and classes as needed. -->
     <!-- The use of namespaces helps to avoid naming conflicts and provides clarity in the model.
     The example.org namespace is used here, but in a real application, a more specific namespace should be used. -->
     <!-- The schema is designed to be machine-readable, allowing for integration with other systems and data sources.
     This can facilitate data exchange and interoperability in financial applications related to mortgages. -->
     <!-- The RDF schema can be used in various applications, such as mortgage management systems,
     customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and financial analytics platforms.
     It provides a foundation for representing mortgage-related data in a structured and standardized way. -->
     <!-- The schema can be serialized in various formats, such as Turtle or JSON-LD,
     to suit different use cases and preferences.
     This flexibility allows developers to choose the format that best fits their needs and existing systems. -->
     <!-- The schema can be validated against RDF validation tools to ensure its correctness and adherence to standards.
     This helps maintain data integrity and consistency across applications that use the schema.
     Regular updates and maintenance of the schema can help keep it relevant and aligned with evolving business requirements. -->
     <!-- The schema can be documented with additional comments and descriptions to provide context and usage guidelines.
     This documentation can be useful for developers and data analysts working with the schema,
     ensuring they understand the purpose and relationships of the defined classes and properties.
