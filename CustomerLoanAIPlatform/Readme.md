| API Gateway | Authentication, Throttling (AWS API Gateway, NGINX, Kong)| 
| AI Core Engine | LLMs, LangChain, DSPy, Semantic Kernel, Document Intelligence| 
| Contextual Retrieval (RAG) | Pinecone, FAISS, Vector Search APIs| 
| Risk Assessment & Scoring | ML Models (XGBoost, SHAP), Creditworthiness| 
| Personalization Layer | NLP summarization, recommendation models| 
| Backend Services | Compliance Engines, SQL/NoSQL DBs, Audit Logging| 
| Notification Layer | Kafka, SNS, Twilio, Zapier, Slack| 

### 🔧 API Modules
| API Module	| Description |
| :--- | --- |
| Loan Intake API	| Collects applicant data, documents, and consent |
| Eligibility Check API	| ML-based decisioning for real-time qualification |
| Document Intelligence API	| Extracts structured info from scanned docs and PDFs |
| Offer Personalization API	| Generates tailored loan products using RAG & feature store |
| Risk & Compliance API	| Flags anomalies, logs scoring, ensures policy adherence |
| Feedback Loop API	| Captures feedback, post-loan behavior for retraining |
| Notification API	| Manages email/SMS/Slack alerts on status and milestones |

### ⚠️ Failure Scenarios & Mitigation
| Failure Scenario	| Strategy |
| :--- | --- |
| Model Drift / Bias	| Drift detection via Evidently or WhyLabs |
| API Timeout	| Circuit breakers, retries, async queues |
| Extraction Errors	| Heuristic fallback + human-in-loop |
| Third-party Downtime	| Caching, failover logic, service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) |
| Regulatory Misalignment	| Real-time policy validation, rule engines (OPA, Regula) |

#### 🔁 Load Balancing & Scalability
| Component	| Approach |
| :--- | --- |
| API Gateway	| Rate limiting, autoscaling, health checks via ALBs| 
| Model Inference	| Multi-region endpoints (SageMaker, Vertex AI)| 
| Document Processing	| Parallelized with worker pools (Celery, SQS)| 
| Vector Store	| Sharded and replicated with Pinecone/FAISS| 
| Notifications	| Dead-letter queues via Kafka/Kinesis|
