## 📐 Software Architecture
Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a system, including component interactions, data flow, and design principles for scalability, security, and maintainability.

### Software Architecture Classifications
Software architecture can be classified into different categories based on structure, design principles, and system interactions. Here are some common classifications:

- **Monolithic Architecture** – Unified system with tightly integrated components  
- **Microservices Architecture** – Independent services communicating via APIs  
- **Layered Architecture** – Presentation, business logic, and data access layers  
- **Event-Driven Architecture** – Reactive systems triggered by events  
- **Client-Server Architecture** – UI separated from backend processing  
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture** – Decentralized node communication  
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** – Reusable service-based design  
- **Hexagonal Architecture** – Ports and adapters isolate business logic  
- **Microkernel Architecture** – Core system with plug-in extensibility  
- **Space-Based Architecture** – Distributed processing across nodes  


#### Software Architecture Patterns
There are several types of software architecture patterns, each suited for different use cases:
- Layered Architecture – Organizes software into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to improve modularity and separation of concerns.
- Microservices Architecture – Breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate via APIs, enhancing scalability and flexibility.
- Event-Driven Architecture – Uses events to trigger actions across different components, making it ideal for real-time processing.
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) – Uses services as building blocks for applications, promoting reusability and scalability.
- Serverless Architecture – Runs applications without managing infrastructure, relying on cloud services for execution.
- Monolithic Architecture – A single, unified application structure where all components are tightly integrated.
- Client-Server Architecture – Separates the client (user interface) from the server (data processing), commonly used in web applications.
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture – Allows nodes to communicate directly without a central server, often used in decentralized systems.

## 🧠 AI Architecture

AI architecture defines the structure of intelligent systems that leverage machine learning, natural language processing, and generative models.

### AI Modalities

- **ML (Machine Learning)** – Predictive modeling from structured data  
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** – Language understanding and generation  
- **LLM (Large Language Models)** – Generative and conversational AI  
- **SLM (Small Language Models)** – Lightweight, domain-specific models  
- **SML (Symbolic Machine Learning)** – Hybrid rule-based/statistical learning  

### AI Architecture Layers

| **Layer**               | **Function** |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Data Layer              | Ingestion, transformation, storage  
| Model Layer             | Training, evaluation, serving  
| Orchestration Layer     | Workflow coordination, agent logic  
| Interface Layer         | APIs, chat UIs, embedded modules  
| Governance Layer        | Security, compliance, ethical oversight  

### AI Architecture Patterns

- Microservices + AI Agents  
- Event-Driven AI Workflows  
- Semantic Layer Integration  
- Hybrid Cloud AI Deployment  
- API Gateway for AI Inference  
- Vector Search & Embedding Matching

## 🔗 Integration Architecture

Integration architecture defines how systems and applications communicate and share data across platforms.

### Integration Architecture Classifications

- **API-Based Integration** – REST, GraphQL, gRPC  
- **Event-Driven Integration** – Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Event Grid  
- **Streaming Integration** – Spark Streaming, Flink, Redis Streams  
- **Middleware Integration** – MuleSoft, Dell Boomi, Apache Camel  
- **Metadata-Driven Integration** – Declarative orchestration via YAML/JSON  
- **Semantic Integration** – Embedding-based matching via vector DBs  

### Integration Architecture Patterns

- Adapter Pattern  
- Facade Pattern  
- Saga Pattern  
- Circuit Breaker Pattern  
- API Gateway Pattern  
- Message Broker Pattern

## 🗃️ Data Architecture

Data architecture can be classified under SaaS (Software as a Service), BI (Business Intelligence), or Database depending on its purpose and implementation:
- SaaS Data Architecture – Focuses on managing cloud-based applications and ensuring data integrity, security, and scalability for multi-tenant environments. It often integrates with cloud platforms to optimize performance.
- BI Data Architecture – Designed for analytics and reporting, involving data ingestion, preparation, warehousing, and visualization. It supports structured data models for enterprise reporting.
- Database Architecture – Defines how data is stored, managed, and accessed within databases. It includes relational and non-relational databases, data lakes, and data warehouses.

Some architectures blend these approaches, using SaaS-based data platforms to enhance BI capabilities while maintaining cloud-native scalability. 

#### Data Architecture Classifications
Data architecture classifications define how data is structured, stored, and managed within an organization. Here are some common classifications:
- Centralized Architecture – All data is stored in a single repository, making access and management easier.
- Decentralized Architecture – Data is distributed across multiple locations, improving scalability and resilience.
- Cloud-Based Architecture – Uses cloud platforms for storage and processing, offering flexibility and scalability.
- On-Premises Architecture – Data is stored and managed within an organization's physical infrastructure.
- Hybrid Architecture – Combines cloud and on-premises solutions for optimized performance.
- Data Lake Architecture – Stores raw, unstructured data for future processing and analysis.
- Data Warehouse Architecture – Organizes structured data for reporting and analytics.
- Event-Driven Architecture – Processes data in real-time based on triggered events.

## 🧩 Solution Architecture

<li>Solution architecture is the design and structure of a specific solution within a broader system, focusing on how components work together to meet business requirements.</li>
<li>It includes defining the technology stack, integration points, data flow, and user interactions.</li>
<li>Solution architecture is often used to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation, ensuring that the solution aligns with organizational goals.</li>
<li>It involves creating detailed diagrams, specifications, and documentation to guide development and implementation.</li>

### Solution Architecture Classifications
Solution architecture can be classified into different categories based on the scope, complexity, and technology stack. Here are some common classifications:
- Enterprise Architecture – A comprehensive framework that aligns IT strategy with business goals, covering all aspects of an organization’s technology landscape.
- Application Architecture – Focuses on the design and structure of specific applications, including their components, interactions, and data flow.
- Integration Architecture – Defines how different systems and applications communicate and share data, often using APIs, middleware, or messaging systems.

### Solution Architecture Patterns
Solution architecture patterns provide reusable solutions to common design problems. Here are some widely used patterns:
- Microservices Pattern – Breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate via APIs, enhancing scalability and flexibility.
- Event-Driven Pattern – Uses events to trigger actions across different components, making it ideal for real-time processing and decoupling services.
- Layered Pattern – Organizes software into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to improve modularity and separation of concerns.

- Service-Oriented Pattern – Uses services as building blocks for applications, promoting reusability and scalability.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) – Separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.
- API Gateway Pattern – Centralizes access to microservices, providing a single entry point for clients and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting.
- Circuit Breaker Pattern – Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems by stopping requests to failing services
- Saga Pattern – Manages long-running transactions and complex workflows in distributed systems, ensuring data consistency.
