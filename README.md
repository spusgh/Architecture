## Software Architecture
Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system, defining how components interact, how data flows, and how the system is designed for scalability, security, and maintainability.

#### Software Architecture Classifications
Software architecture can be classified into different categories based on structure, design principles, and system interactions. Here are some common classifications:
- Monolithic Architecture – A single, unified system where all components are tightly integrated.
- Microservices Architecture – Breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
- Layered Architecture – Organizes software into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to improve modularity.
- Event-Driven Architecture – Uses events to trigger actions across different components, ideal for real-time processing.
- Client-Server Architecture – Separates the client (user interface) from the server (data processing), commonly used in web applications.
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture – Allows nodes to communicate directly without a central server, often used in decentralized systems.
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) – Uses services as building blocks for applications, promoting reusability and scalability.
- Hexagonal Architecture – Also known as Ports and Adapters, it isolates business logic from external dependencies.
- Microkernel Architecture – A core system with plug-in modules for extensibility.
- Space-Based Architecture – Designed for scalability by distributing processing across multiple nodes.

#### Software Architecture Patterns
There are several types of software architecture patterns, each suited for different use cases:
- Layered Architecture – Organizes software into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to improve modularity and separation of concerns.
- Microservices Architecture – Breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate via APIs, enhancing scalability and flexibility.
- Event-Driven Architecture – Uses events to trigger actions across different components, making it ideal for real-time processing.
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) – Uses services as building blocks for applications, promoting reusability and scalability.
- Serverless Architecture – Runs applications without managing infrastructure, relying on cloud services for execution.
- Monolithic Architecture – A single, unified application structure where all components are tightly integrated.
- Client-Server Architecture – Separates the client (user interface) from the server (data processing), commonly used in web applications.
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture – Allows nodes to communicate directly without a central server, often used in decentralized systems.

## Data Architecture
Data architecture can be classified under SaaS (Software as a Service), BI (Business Intelligence), or Database depending on its purpose and implementation:
- SaaS Data Architecture – Focuses on managing cloud-based applications and ensuring data integrity, security, and scalability for multi-tenant environments. It often integrates with cloud platforms to optimize performance.
- BI Data Architecture – Designed for analytics and reporting, involving data ingestion, preparation, warehousing, and visualization. It supports structured data models for enterprise reporting.
- Database Architecture – Defines how data is stored, managed, and accessed within databases. It includes relational and non-relational databases, data lakes, and data warehouses.

Some architectures blend these approaches, using SaaS-based data platforms to enhance BI capabilities while maintaining cloud-native scalability. 

#### Data Architecture Classifications
Data architecture classifications define how data is structured, stored, and managed within an organization. Here are some common classifications:
- Centralized Architecture – All data is stored in a single repository, making access and management easier.
- Decentralized Architecture – Data is distributed across multiple locations, improving scalability and resilience.
- Cloud-Based Architecture – Uses cloud platforms for storage and processing, offering flexibility and scalability.
- On-Premises Architecture – Data is stored and managed within an organization's physical infrastructure.
- Hybrid Architecture – Combines cloud and on-premises solutions for optimized performance.
- Data Lake Architecture – Stores raw, unstructured data for future processing and analysis.
- Data Warehouse Architecture – Organizes structured data for reporting and analytics.
- Event-Driven Architecture – Processes data in real-time based on triggered events.
